Using Transparency
CSS gradients also support transparency, which can be used to create fading effects.

To add transparency, we use the rgba() function to define the color stops. 
The last parameter in the rgba() function can be a value from 0 to 1, c
and it defines the transparency of the color: 0 indicates full transparency, 
1 indicates full color (no transparency).

The following example shows a linear gradient that starts from the left. 
It starts fully transparent, transitioning to full color red:

CSS gradients let you display smooth transitions between two or more specified colors.

CSS defines three types of gradients:

Linear Gradients (goes down/up/left/right/diagonally)
Radial Gradients (defined by their center)
Conic Gradients (rotated around a center point)
CSS Linear Gradients
To create a linear gradient you must define at least two color stops. 
Color stops are the colors you want to render smooth transitions among. 
You can also set a starting point and a direction (or an angle) 
along with the gradient effect.
